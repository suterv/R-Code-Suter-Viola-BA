# R Code for Bachelor's Thesis: The Impact
This repository contains the R scripts used in my Bachelor's thesis on "The Impact of the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval on Spot Returns and Volatility of Major Cryptocurrencies."

## Files

- Corrected, essential codes for analysis and visualization of:
    - Chapter 2: Data Selection and Stylized Facts of crypto data
    - Chapter 3: Checking which model among GARCH, EGRACH, GJR-GARCH and ARJI-GARCH fits best to my data
    - Chapter 5: Fitted the EGARCH Model 1 and 2
    - Codes for Appendices D and F, which essentially are the same line of codes as one finds in the other files, but on other data ranges
    - Examples of the most frequent ChatGPT prompts
    - CSV files: Data for histrorical cryptocurrency prices used in thesis

## How to Use  
Simply copy everything into R. All the required packages are listed within the respective code sections, so you know exactly which ones to install.  
Make sure you also have the necessary data with the correct file path.  

Additionally, there are comments throughout the code. However, don’t take my comments too seriously—they are not highly scientific. I often used smileys :)  

My original R scripts are quite messy, unstructured, and mixed with incorrect lines of code where I experimented with different things. They are not included here.  

If, for some unexplainable reason, someone wants to look at them (though even I don’t understand what I was trying to do in some parts), please feel free to contact me.
